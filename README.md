aio-nag-st2
==================

Creates an AIO installation of OpenStack, a Nagios monitoring VM and a StackStorm Server using Vagrant and VirtualBox.

Clone the repo and run ***vagrant up*** to create the whole enviroment.  Linked Clones are used within VirtualBox so the disk space requirements are kept as low as possible.

Warning - the current vagrant file has not been optimised for the Windows version of Vagrant, and has only been tested on OSX - it may need some updates to work on windows hosts.
